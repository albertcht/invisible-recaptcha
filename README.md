## Notice
* This branch is for multi-forms purpose.
* In most of cases, there should be only one captcha in your page. You should use master branch normally.
* **Do not use multiple captchas in one page for protecting every form far from bots**, it will cause terrible user experience.

## Notice

* The master branch doesn't support multi captchas feature, please use `multi-forms` branch if you need it. (**Most of the time you are misusing recaptcha when you try to put multiple captchas in one page.**)

## Installation

```
composer require albertcht/invisible-recaptcha:dev-multi-forms
```

## Usage Example
```php
// you must include `jquery` beforehand
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

{!! Form::open(['url' => '/', 'id' => 'form1']) !!}
@captcha()
{!! Form::submit('Sumbit', ['id'=>'s1']) !!}
{!! Form::close() !!}

{!! Form::open(['url' => '/']) !!}
@captcha()
{!! Form::submit('Sumbit2', ['id'=>'s2']) !!}
{!! Form::close() !!}
```
> **Please include jquery.js manually before you calling the captcha.**

> Just call captcha function in forms directly, it will render only one captcha and all the forms will share the same captcha validation.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
    $('#s2').on('captcha', function(e) {
        // set it to false if you don't want to submit your from directly
        _submitAction = false;
        // do other stuff
    });
</script>
```
> In this branch, you can cutomize your submit behavior by listening a captcha event.

## Example Repository

Repo: https://github.com/albertcht/invisible-recaptcha-example/tree/multi-forms

This repo demonstrates how to use this package with ajax way.

## Diffs
* There's no `INVISIBLE_RECAPTCHA_DEBUG` config in this branch.
* This package rely on `jquery` instead of `pilyfill.js`, and you have to include `jquery` by yourself before you call the captcha.

### This branch is still under develop, welcome for any deg report or advice.
